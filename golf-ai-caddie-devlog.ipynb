I may take over 100 shots tho so maybe I can make another form in streamlit with a separate page/tab that asks for date and time for that entry, but then how would I track each golf swing.... like for instance if I go to top golf, ill use different clubs and each ball hit needs to have a specific direction and they need to be ordered to match the blast motion correctly.\n","NEED a scalable way to log direction per shot\n","is there a way to have the data and time be automatic instead of typing that in? Also maybe I can ask the user (haha me) for location and then automatically make the sessionID with that and then the date in the \"topgolf0416\" format. Then I can ask the user for an estimated time like three hours and it will automatically use that sessionID for three hours so I don't have to repediently type that in either.\n","YES once we hit submit a text appears like \"That was submitted\" and then the boxes are cleared of data (but still saved in csv). Can we also start a timer on the top of the page to let the user know how long it will be logging that session id for? I also would love for the submit button and boxes being cleared to happen for the first form we created.\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
