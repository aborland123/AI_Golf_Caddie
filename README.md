# AI_Golf_Caddie

Want to create an app that I can use on a golf course and it tell me the best club to use, how to hit it, and how hard, etc, based on my past data.

Data Collection:
- Arccos Caddie (tracks club usage, distance, direction, and hole position) -- has CSV export
- Blast Motion (Cheapest & tracks grip, swing, tempo, speed, and face rotation) -- has CSV export
- Using Python to code
- Using Streamlit for Interface


Want to incorporate AI to tell me:
- Pull all shots from 135–155 yards in your data
- Notice that your 8 iron tends to come up short, but 7 iron is reliably long
- “Use your 7 iron. Hit it at ~90% swing. Slightly favor a fade — you tend to pull your 7.”
